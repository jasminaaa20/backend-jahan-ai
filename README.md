# Back End Developer Case Study

## Overview

You are responsible for developing the backend for a user preferences page using the Django framework ([https://www.djangoproject.com/](https://www.djangoproject.com/)) for a web application.

The user preferences page will enable users to customize their settings according to their preferences. Your objective is to design and create an extensible and robust backend using modern web technologies.

## Requirements

- **Preference Categories:** Group preferences into categories for easy navigation:
  - **Account Settings:** Manage user account details like username, email, and password.
  - **Notification Settings:** Control email and push notification preferences, including frequency.
  - **Theme Settings:** Customize application theme with options for colors, fonts, and layout.
  - **Privacy Settings:** Manage privacy preferences, including profile visibility and data sharing.
- **Surface simple forms** as the front end to modify preferences.
- **Modular Design:** Ensure that the approach can be extended to new preference categories and options.
- **Validation and Error Handling:** Implement robust validation and error handling mechanisms to ensure data integrity and provide meaningful error messages to users when modifying preferences.
- **Testing:** Write unit and functional tests to ensure proper functionality.

## Deliverables

- A walkthrough of your approach to the following (as a discussion). Implementing the full solution is not required:
  - The app.
  - How you went / go about it.
  - Key features and call-outs.
  - How you would deploy.
  - How you would test in a more robust way.

- If any part of the solution has been implemented (this can be WIP code), a git
repo with the code. Alternatively, share a link to any of your existing code
showcasing relevant work.
